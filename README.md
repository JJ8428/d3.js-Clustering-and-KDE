# d3.js-Clustering-and-KDE
Simple d3.js implementation of a scatter plot that can show clustering analyses and a hard-coded KDE (step triangle). This shows what I am capable of doing with Javascript.

This was a page I coded for my Senior Capstone Project to provide data analysis and visualization.

To run it, simply download the git repo, and HTML file in a web browser. Feel free to change/modify the data itself, but please note that too many coordinates of Phi and Psi angle can reduce the porformance.

This was used with Vue.js engine in my senior capstone project.
